## Project Name

**Mini-Blog**

## Description

A simple and intuitive blogging platform that allows users to create, read, and manage their blog posts with ease. Built with a modern tech stack, Blogify provides a clean and user-friendly interface for both authors and readers. Users can add new blog posts, view all posts, and filter posts by authors. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to dive into web development and learn the basics of building a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application.

## Features

- Create new blog posts with a title, body, and author.
- View a list of all blog posts.
- Filter blog posts by different authors.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: JSON Server (for simplicity)
- Styling: CSS

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Start the JSON Server and React development server.
4. Navigate to the app in your browser and start blogging!





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
